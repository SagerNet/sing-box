!!! note ""

    You can ignore the JSON Array [] tag when the content is only one item

!!! warning ""

    If tun is running in non-privileged mode, addresses and MTU will not be configured automatically, please make sure the settings are accurate.

### Fields

#### interface_name

Virtual device name, automatically selected if empty.

#### address

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.10.0"

IPv4 and IPv6 prefix for the tun interface.

#### inet4_address

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.10.0"

    `inet4_address` is merged to `address` and will be removed in sing-box 1.11.0.

IPv4 prefix for the tun interface.

#### inet6_address

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.10.0"

    `inet6_address` is merged to `address` and will be removed in sing-box 1.11.0.

IPv6 prefix for the tun interface.

#### mtu

The maximum transmission unit.

#### gso

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.8.0"

!!! quote ""

    Only supported on Linux with `auto_route` enabled.

Enable generic segmentation offload.

#### auto_route

Set the default route to the Tun.

!!! quote ""

    To avoid traffic loopback, set `route.auto_detect_interface` or `route.default_interface` or `outbound.bind_interface`

!!! note "Use with Android VPN"

    By default, VPN takes precedence over tun. To make tun go through VPN, enable `route.override_android_vpn`.

#### iproute2_table_index

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.10.0"

Linux iproute2 table index generated by `auto_route`.

`2022` is used by default.

#### iproute2_rule_index

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.10.0"

Linux iproute2 rule start index generated by `auto_route`.

`9000` is used by default.

#### auto_redirect

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.10.0"

!!! quote ""

    Only supported on Linux with `auto_route` enabled.

Automatically configure iptables/nftables to redirect connections.

*In Android*ï¼š

Only local connections are forwarded. To share your VPN connection over hotspot or repeater,
use [VPNHotspot](https://github.com/Mygod/VPNHotspot).

*In Linux*:

`auto_route` with `auto_redirect` now works as expected on routers **without intervention**.

#### auto_redirect_input_mark

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.10.0"

Connection input mark used by `route_address_set` and `route_exclude_address_set`.

`0x2023` is used by default.

#### auto_redirect_output_mark

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.10.0"

Connection output mark used by `route_address_set` and `route_exclude_address_set`.

`0x2024` is used by default.

#### strict_route

Enforce strict routing rules when `auto_route` is enabled:

*In Linux*:

* Let unsupported network unreachable
* Make ICMP traffic route to tun instead of upstream interfaces
* Route all connections to tun

It prevents IP address leaks and makes DNS hijacking work on Android.

*In Windows*:

* Add firewall rules to prevent DNS leak caused by
  Windows' [ordinary multihomed DNS resolution behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd197552%28v%3Dws.10%29)

It may prevent some applications (such as VirtualBox) from working properly in certain situations.

#### route_address

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.10.0"

Use custom routes instead of default when `auto_route` is enabled.

#### inet4_route_address

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.10.0"

`inet4_route_address` is deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.11.0, please use [route_address](#route_address)
instead.

Use custom routes instead of default when `auto_route` is enabled.

#### inet6_route_address

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.10.0"

`inet6_route_address` is deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.11.0, please use [route_address](#route_address)
instead.

Use custom routes instead of default when `auto_route` is enabled.

#### route_exclude_address

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.10.0"

Exclude custom routes when `auto_route` is enabled.

#### inet4_route_exclude_address

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.10.0"

`inet4_route_exclude_address` is deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.11.0, please
use [route_exclude_address](#route_exclude_address) instead.

Exclude custom routes when `auto_route` is enabled.

#### inet6_route_exclude_address

!!! failure "Deprecated in sing-box 1.10.0"

`inet6_route_exclude_address` is deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.11.0, please
use [route_exclude_address](#route_exclude_address) instead.

Exclude custom routes when `auto_route` is enabled.

#### route_address_set

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.10.0"

!!! quote ""

    Only supported on Linux with nftables and requires `auto_route` and `auto_redirect` enabled.

Add the destination IP CIDR rules in the specified rule-sets to the firewall.
Unmatched traffic will bypass the sing-box routes.

Conflict with `route.default_mark` and `[dialOptions].routing_mark`.

#### route_exclude_address_set

!!! question "Since sing-box 1.10.0"

!!! quote ""

    Only supported on Linux with nftables and requires `auto_route` and `auto_redirect` enabled.

Add the destination IP CIDR rules in the specified rule-sets to the firewall.
Matched traffic will bypass the sing-box routes.

Conflict with `route.default_mark` and `[dialOptions].routing_mark`.

#### endpoint_independent_nat

!!! info ""

    This item is only available on the gvisor stack, other stacks are endpoint-independent NAT by default.

Enable endpoint-independent NAT.

Performance may degrade slightly, so it is not recommended to enable on when it is not needed.

#### udp_timeout

UDP NAT expiration time in seconds, default is 300 (5 minutes).

#### stack
