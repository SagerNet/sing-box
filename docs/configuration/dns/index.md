### Fields

| Key      | Format                          |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| `server` | List of [DNS Server](./server/) |
| `rules`  | List of [DNS Rule](./rule/)     |
| `fakeip` | [FakeIP](./fakeip/)             |

#### final

Default dns server tag.

The first server will be used if empty.

#### strategy

Default domain strategy for resolving the domain names.

One of `prefer_ipv4` `prefer_ipv6` `ipv4_only` `ipv6_only`.

Take no effect if `server.strategy` is set.

#### disable_cache

Disable dns cache.

#### disable_expire

Disable dns cache expire.

#### independent_cache

Make each DNS server's cache independent for special purposes. If enabled, will slightly degrade performance.

#### reverse_mapping

Stores a reverse mapping of IP addresses after responding to a DNS query in order to provide domain names when routing.

Since this process relies on the act of resolving domain names by an application before making a request, it can be
problematic in environments such as macOS, where DNS is proxied and cached by the system.

#### fakeip

[FakeIP](./fakeip/) settings.
