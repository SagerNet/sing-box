### Override

Overrides profile configuration items with platform-specific values.

#### Per-app proxy

SFA allows you to select a list of Android apps that require proxying or bypassing in the graphical interface to
override the `include_package` and `exclude_package` configuration items.

In particular, the selector also provides the “China apps” scanning feature, providing Chinese users with an excellent
experience to bypass apps that do not require a proxy. Specifically, by scanning China application or SDK
characteristics through dex class path and other means, there will be almost no missed reports.

### Chore

* The working directory is located at `/sdcard/Android/data/io.nekohasekai.sfa/files` (External files directory)
* Crash logs is located in `$working_directory/stderr.log`
