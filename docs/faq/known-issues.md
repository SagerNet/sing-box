#### DNS

##### on macOS

`auto-route` cannot automatically hijack DNS requests sent to the LAN, so it's need to manually set DNS to servers on the public internet.

##### on Android

`auto-route` cannot automatically hijack DNS requests when Android's `Private DNS` is enabled.

#### System proxy

##### on Linux

Usually only browsers and GNOME applications accept GNOME proxy settings.

##### on Android

With the system proxy enabled, some applications will error out (usually from China).
