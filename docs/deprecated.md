#### GeoIP

GeoIP is deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.12.0.

The maxmind GeoIP National Database, as an IP classification database,
is not entirely suitable for traffic bypassing,
and all existing implementations suffer from high memory usage and difficult management.

check [Migration](/migration/#migrate-geoip-to-rule-sets).

#### Geosite

Geosite is deprecated and will be removed in sing-box 1.12.0.

check [Migration](/migration/#migrate-geosite-to-rule-sets).

## 1.6.0

The following features will be marked deprecated in 1.5.0 and removed entirely in 1.6.0.

#### ShadowsocksR

ShadowsocksR support has never been enabled by default, since the most commonly used proxy sales panel in the
illegal industry stopped using this protocol, it does not make sense to continue to maintain it.

#### Proxy Protocol

Proxy Protocol is added by Pull Request, has problems, is only used by the backend of HTTP multiplexers such as nginx,
is intrusive, and is meaningless for proxy purposes.
